# Ontario Trillium Foundation Grant Funding Analysis Methodology

Ontario Trillium Foundation (OTF) is the largest grant foundation in Canada, and as a foundation entirely dependent on Ontario government funding,it is an instrument of government policy through granting priorities in the social economy. One of Ontario Trillium Foundations goals is to encourage best practices in the social economy in Ontario.
One of these best practices is transparency, and the Ontario Trillium Foundations transparency initiatives has been publication of its grants information as Open Data [Ontario Trillium Foundation Open Data](https://otf.ca/open).
The OTF grant datasets provide a comprehensive view of funding through the foundation to social economy organizations serving individuals with disabilities in Ontario.

## Research Questions answerable through the OTF Datasets

**Primary Question:**

1) Is there a difference between grants for organizations serving individuals with disabilities, and other grants, for the following parameters:
* Number of grants
* Dollar value of grants
* Number of organizations

**Secondary Question:**

2) Do the datasets allow for intersectional analysis, e.g. grants supporting both disability and race?

**Tertiary Question:**

3) Do the available fields in the database e.g. Recipient Org:Charitable Registration Number allow combination with other datasets such as Revenue Canada’s T3010 database for analysis?

Revenue Canada T3010 data is another dataset that requires more attention from social scientists, particularly social scientists researching charities in Canada and more broadly social economy organizations.
Note that Revenue Canadas T3010 database is published as a searchable data base available to the public at: [Government of Canada - List of Charities - basic search](https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/hacc/srch/pub/dsplyBscSrch).
In this document, a set of files available on request from Revenue Canada was utilized rather than the search pages.  The matching of data completed here is much more efficiently accomplished using the data files.
The Revenue Canada T3010 data file was published 17 July 2020, and subsequently received through postal mail in the subsequent week.
Revenue Canada T3010 data is not _required_ for the majority  of analysis completed here, and is not required to answer the primary and secondary research questions.
Revenue Canada T3010 data is required to answer the tertiary question, proving it can be done here, and not the focus of effort.

The downloadable OTF data sets were retrieved from: [Ontario Trillium Foundation Open Data](https://otf.ca/open) on June 26, 2020.
There is an OTF Data Inventory which provides a list of all the datasets available from the same website
Filename: otf_data_inventory_en

The most relevant Revenue Canada files for analysis to be completed here are:
1. T3010_2017ONBasicContactInfo
2. T3010_2017ONFinancialInfo

All the Revenue Canada T3010 files are related to each other through the BN/Registration Number field.
Therefore in connecting any other datasets to the Revenue Canada T3010 set of files, the BN/Registration Number has to be accurate and match Revenue Canada format.

Some conventions:
* In the remainder of this document, the files are referenced by their filename e.g. name_of_file.xyz rather than a log form description
* In the remainder of this document, the English field names foreach field will be used for brevity, assuming that the French field names simply contain the same information, but in French.

## Quality Issues and Detailed Methodology
OTF grant data is not perfect or ‘clean’ data.
There are missing fields, and incorrect data.
But it is mostly complete and mostly accurate data, and in the absence of other sources of equivalent data, cleaning the dataset and filling in the missing values as much as possible is the best option.
The steps required to clean the dataset to a reasonable level are outlined here. Although some of the steps may seem pedantic, it is similar to a science experiment, where the steps if rigorously reported in detail, can be replicated by other people to verify and validate the result.
One of the benefits of Open Data is the ability for multiple researchers to access to the same dataset and do different analyses, or do the same analyses to verify each others results (Peters, 2013).
Social science researchers are notorious for not providing enough data or a detailed enough methodology that enables replication by others.
OTF will benefit from the investment it has already made in releasing its grant data as open data by more researchers using the data.
In some ways, reporting the detailed steps taken to clean up data in this thesis as a published and public document will encourage OTF to apply the same cleanup steps to upcoming releases for the dataset to make it cleaner and more accessible for all future researchers.
More broadly OTF’s objective of transparency in the social economy will be supported by demonstrating the type of analysis that can be done by researchers on OTF Grant Open Data.


# Methodology for otf_granting_data_since_april_1_2015

## Analyze the cleanest dataset first

The file otf_granting_data_since_april_1_2015 is the cleanest dataset, or the dataset with the least amount of effort required to transform it into a usable dataset since it is the most recent.
The reason the cleanest dataset is selected is that data cleanup processes are activities with diminishing returns.
If we can perform analysis with a lower level of cleanup, the dataset more valuable on the utility vs effort scale.
We can also take lessons learned from analyzing the cleanest dataset and apply them to datasets that require more effort for cleanup and analysis

## OpenRefine

OpenRefine is a free, Open Source tool available to everyone for data analysis at [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/).
Since OpenRefine is a tool specifically designed for cleaning up and analyzing data, it provides a number of powerful features.
For example the Facet feature allows easy clustering of data that is similar, where the data entered is slightly different, but belongs in the same group.
The same results are achievable using MS Excel and the Pivot Tables function but it takes more steps and therefore more time.   

**Why clustering within the same field is required**

Most of the differences between common descriptions are either errors in data entry, or a change in a common term is used in grant applications over time. As OPen Refine describes it "This feature helps you find groups of different cell values that might be alternative representations of the same thing. For example, the two strings "New York" and "new york" are very likely to refer to the same concept and just have capitalization differences, and "Gödel" and "Godel" probably refer to the same person."
For example, the following terms mean the same thing for the purposes of analysis here:
1.	People with disabilities
2.	Individuals with disabilities
And therefore when counting the number of records, we need to be able to count all records with both these term together, in other words “cluster” them together.

e.g. In the same step in OpenRefine Facet clustering in the field Population Served:
Records using “LGBTQIA” were combined with records using “LGBTQ+”, and for the purpose of analysis the description “LGBTQIA” was used.

In most cases a different description or a description independent of existing descriptions used in grant records was not used.  Usually the more commonly used or broader term was used.

![Figure 1: Example 1 Clustering data using Open Refine](Fig-1-Example1-Clustering-data-using-Open-Refine.png)*Figure 1: Example 1 Clustering data using Open Refine*

e.g. In the following step in OpenRefine Facet clustering in the field Population Served:
Records using “Indigenous or Aboriginal” were combined with records using “Indigenous”, and for the purpose of analysis the description “Indigenous or Aboriginal” was used.

### Fields not used for further analysis

Data in all fields used for analysis need to be cleaned up.
Therefore, to minimize unnecessary cleanup effort it is useful to identify fields which will not be used for further analysis.  The following fields are mostly common across all grants, so they are not included for further analysis
* Funding Org: commonly “Ontario Trillium Foundation”
* Country Served: commonly “Canada”

The following are internal OTF administrative data such as a unique identifier for each grant, that is not for the purposes of this analysis
* Identifier
* Organization name
* Submission date
* Approval date
* Cross-catchment indicator
* Geographical Area Served
* Recipient Org:City
* Recipient Org:Postal Code
* Co-Application
* Rescinded/Recovered
* Rescinded/Recovered Initiated By
* Amount Rescinded/Recovered
* Last modified

One might think “Organization name” is an important field in determining for example the number of grants received per organization.
Since organization names are prone to data entry errors, the more exact Recipient Org:Incorporation Number and Recipient Org:Charitable Registration Number are used for organization level analysis.
Similarly, one might think Postal code is a useful field e.g. the United Way report, Poverty by Postal Code: The geography of neighbourhood poverty (https://www.unitedwaygt.org/research-and-reports), was a seminal report.
But in this case, the postal code provided in the file otf_granting_data_since_april_1_2015 is the **head office** of the grant recipient organization.
Geographical area served better indicator, but it is a wide area based on LHINs, which is too broad a geographical area for analysis.

### Fields used for further analysis
In the file otf_granting_data_since_april_1_2015:¬
The primary field including data to determine if the grant is related to **disability** is:
* Population Served

Grants where the Population Served was “People with Disabilities” was analyzed for differences in the following fields.  
* Fiscal Year
* Grant Programme
* Amount Applied For
* Amount Awarded
* Planned Dates:Duration (months)
* Description (English)
* Program Area
* Budget Fund
* Age Group
* Recipient Org:Incorporation Number
* Recipient Org:Charitable Registration Number
